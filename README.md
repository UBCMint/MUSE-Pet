# MUSE-Pet

Like a tamagatchi pet, the MUSE pet is also a virtual game where the health of the pet is affected by the user's mental state- focused versus unfocused.
The MUSE headset is used to collect user EEG data, and real time signal processing is used to predict the user's attentitveness. 

## Signal Processing
